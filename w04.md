# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [The Fetch-Execute Cycle: What's Your Computer Actually Doing?](https://youtu.be/Z5JC9Ve1sfI)<br>
The fetch-execute cycle is the basis of everything your computer or phone does, but how is it really works? In this somewhat brief video with cool graphic will explain the basic of the cycle, and that graphic thing is actually helping a lot to understand this topic better.

2. [Pointers in C Explained - They're Not as Difficult as You Think](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pointers-in-c-are-not-as-difficult-as-you-think/)<br>
In this article, we will go from the very basics of pointers to their usage with arrays, functions, and structure. Since for now pointers are arguably the most difficult feature of C to understand, this article really help me to grasp the idea of pointer.

3. [What is Endianness? Big-Endian vs Little-Endian Explained ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-endianness-big-endian-vs-little-endian/)<br>
As seen in the title, this article explains what endianness is, what big-endian and little-endian are, and also there are some picture that will help you understand these concepts more clearly. Until few days ago, sometimes I forgot the concept of endianness but not when I found this article.

4. [Virtual Memory Simulator](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/smitha/ParaCache/Paracache/vm.html)<br>
A virtual memory simulator web program based that will help you understand more about this topic a lot better. Also, if you are not familiar about it and have no idea what to do, the web provides you with a guide in a file that contains base knowledge both about memory and how to operate the simulator.

5. [Why is Data Fragmentation Not Possible on Main Memory (RAM)?](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/50090/why-is-data-fragmentation-not-possible-on-main-memory-ram)<br>
Such an interesting question, isn't it? I found this very question while I'm searching about fragmentation. If you want to know the answer like I did, then go visit the website because someone has already answered it for you with nice explanation.

6. [Dynamic Libraries In the C Programming Language](https://www.medium.com/meatandmachines/shared-dynamic-libraries-in-the-c-programming-language-8c2c03311756)<br>
Came across wondering what's the example of dynamic libraries in C when I read the book, this article is giving me one. Provided with pieces of code, the explanation is pretty understandable.

7. [How Virtual Memory Works?](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/virtual-memory.htm)<br>
In this article, you will learn exactly what virtual memory is, what your computer uses it for and how to configure it on your own machine to achieve optimal performance, yeah for real, how to configure it. I found this site interesing since I don't think that an explanation article really provides you with such explanation.

8. [Intro and Deep Dive into Paging](https://os.phil-opp.com/paging-introduction/)<br>
This well-explained post introduced two memory protection techniques: segmentation and paging. While the former uses variable-sized memory regions and suffers from external fragmentation, the latter uses fixed-sized pages and allows much more fine-grained control over access permissions. The article not only talking about paging, but also its other related.

9. [Swapping in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/swapping-in-operating-system)<br>
This article will be covering the concept of swapping in the Operating system, both from definition, advantages, and disadvantages. Provided with diagram picture, I found this article helping me to understand this topic better.

10. [What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-memory-allocation/)<br>
How'd you come up with the answer? Don't worry this article served it for you. Also, rather than just full-text explanation, it provide you with some C code, in which will help you a lot to visualize. After reading this article, now I know much better than before only read the book.
