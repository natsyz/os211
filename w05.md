# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [**Page Replacement Algorithm Solver**](https://nicomedes.assistedcoding.eu/#/app/os/page_replacement)<br>
Yes, this page will help you to calculate page replacement algorithm (FIFO, LRU, and OPT). I'm so glad that I found this site, even though it's kinda late for me not searching this earlier. 

2. [**Buddy System Method Interactive Visualization**](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/Everything/html/Buddy.html)<br>
What is buddy system exactly? From the name it's sounds catchy, well indeed. This page will explain all you need to know about buddy system and it also provides you with interactive visualisations to help you understand more about it. What I love about this page is I can try and play around with the visualization right away.

3. [**High Page Faults, But Plenty of Ram**](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/very-high-hard-page-faults-s-ram-works-fine.3652119/)<br>
It is one of question(problem) that I've encountered with recently, and lucky for me there's someone who have the same problem. That link above leads to a discussion forum, in which this particular questions has been answered, or rather explained. From now I know it is likely that certain application who caused the problem.

4. [**Why Page Faults Are Usually Handled By The OS, Not Hardware?**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60825210/why-page-faults-are-usually-handled-by-the-os-not-hardware)<br>
Another interesting question about page faults, posted in the forum. But here, I think that it has such a good explanation for this question. For short, the answer is if the hardware could handle it on its own, it wouldn't need to fault.

5. [**Page Fault Handling In Operating System**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-fault-handling-in-operating-system/)<br>
One last article about page faults, but this article are not questions like 2 questions above. The article explains how to handle page fault in operating system. Point plus from me, to read and finish the article you don't need to spend lots of your time on it.

6. [**Paging vs Swapping, What's The Difference**](http://www.learnlinux.org.za/courses/build/internals/ch05s03.html)<br>
The issue of swapping and paging is often misunderstood. Swapping and paging are two totally different things. By that, this page explains in depth the difference of the two, but especially in linux system. For me, the contain of the web itself is easy to understand.

7. [**What Are Demand-Paging And Pre-Paging?**](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-demand-paging-and-pre-paging)<br>
In this blog, you can learn about the concept of Demand Paging and Pre-paging that is used in OS. Not just a glance, this blog cover almost everything about the topic from how it works, advantages, and its disadvantages.
It also comes with pictures so it help me to understand even more.

8. [**How Does FIFO Replacement Works**](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/fifo-page-replacement)<br>
First-in, first-out (FIFO) is the simplest among page replacement algorithms. This tutorial page will cover FIFO thoroughly, from the general idea, page faults, pseudocode, example, advantages, and disadvantages. As like the other good tutorial, it also come up with conclusion as its closing statement.

9. [**Techniques to Handle Thrashing**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
This page will guide you through the techniques go handle thrasing, complete with some pictures of graph to help you understand more about it. Just for recall, thrashing is a condition when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible. One thing, I was mistakenly called this method as trashing hehe.

10. [**A New Linux Memory Controller Promises to Save Lots of RAM**](https://thenewstack.io/a-new-linux-memory-controller-promises-to-save-lots-of-ram/)<br>
At first, I thought it was an article about slab allocation. But no, this is an intriguing article about a breakthrough in memory technology. Roman Gushchin, a member of Facebook's Linux kernel engineering team, has proposed a brand new slab memory controller for the Linux kernel.
